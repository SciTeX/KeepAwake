# KeepAwake


A simple windows application that keeps the screen from sleeping. It prevents the system from launching the screen saver if the computer has been idle for a certain amount of time. It does this by disabling the screen saver.

This utility runs in the background tucked away in the system notification area (system tray).

TODO: add an option to override the power settings (e.g. keep the screen from turning itself off, or keep the system from going to sleep after a predetermined time) if desired by the user.
